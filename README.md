# 🎓 Student Course Registration System

A Java-based GUI application designed to simplify the course registration process for students at an academic institution. This system streamlines course enrollment by offering a user-friendly interface for data entry, course selection, and tracking of registrations.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To develop a GUI-based application that allows students to:

- Log in securely
- View and browse available courses
- Register for courses in real-time
- Provide instant feedback upon registration
- Allow admins to manage course offerings and view registration statistics

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** (Swing/JavaFX for GUI)
- **MySQL** (Backend database)
- **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity)
- **DAO Pattern** (Data Access Layer)
- **NetBeans** or IntelliJ (Recommended IDEs)

---

## 🧩 Project Modules

### 👤 Student Side
1. **Login Screen** – Secure student authentication  
2. **Course Browser** – List of all available courses  
3. **Registration** – Select and enroll in courses  
4. **Feedback System** – Real-time success/error messages  

### 🛡️ Admin Panel
- Add/edit/delete courses
- View registered students per course
- Export registration data (optional)

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Login**: Student logs into the system
2. **Browse Courses**: UI displays available courses
3. **Register**: User selects desired courses
4. **Validation**: App checks for constraints (duplicate, full capacity, etc.)
5. **Database Update**: DAO classes interact with MySQL via JDBC
6. **Feedback**: Success/failure messages shown in UI

## 🎯 Expected Results

- A robust and intuitive course registration system  
- Secure student logins and admin access  
- Real-time database operations with confirmation messages  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Modular, well-documented codebase for easy maintenance

---

## 📦 Deployment Requirements

- Java 8+
- MySQL Server (XAMPP or standalone)
- JDBC Driver
- Java-compatible IDE (NetBeans preferred)
